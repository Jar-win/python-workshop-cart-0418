# Data Analysis Workshop Files
This repository consists of the files that were used to in the *Data Analysis Using Python Workshop*, conducted by Center for Advanced Research & Training, Christ University, Bangalore. <br/>
These are ipython notebook (jupyter) and the standard way to open them is via jupyter browser. <br>

I might add a couple of notebooks on symbolic computation (sympy) by the first week of may. Do a raincheck at that time.
For any other issues and/or confusion regarding the notebooks, feel free to email me.
